# mobile-robotics
MATLAB/Python Jupyter Notebooks for Mobile Robotics. A lot of this code is based on code presented in the University of Waterloo's ME 597 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics class. The class required MATLAB, but I prefer Python so I try to do a bit of both to understand some of the shortcomings that may still exist in Python.
